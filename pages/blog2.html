                    <p class="post-excerpt">We had a couple icebreakers with James, in which we also learned about the basics of how open source works. We then got a tour of the lovely office (and canteen) with Becky. We hd some free time in the middle of the day, so i familiarised myself with the laptop. Later in the day we got set up with github and vscode, covering the basics of git.

                  <p class="post-excerpt">We had a morning workhop with Fortune, where we learned about Agile, which from what I gathered is a problem solving and creative framework that has a heavy emphasis on collaboration and open communication, if you run into a problem your first move should be to bring it to others rather than thrash it out on your own. Later on we had a workshop with Dominik on microbit. We programmed the microbits using blocks similar to scratch, but we also had the option to try it out using python.</p>

                  <p class="post-excerpt">For most of the day we were tasked with creating a rollercoaster track for a ping-pong ball, with the requirement that it had to have a loop in it. Our first design didn't work, so we decided to borrow the other teams design. We then had a talk with Daniel, an Applied Computing student in SETU, where we talked about the student lifestyle, how it differs from secondary school, his path in deciding computer science was for him, and current projects he's working on. We also had a workshop with Dimitri, where he talked on AI, it's uses and a project he was working on, which predicts flooding using satelite imagery using AI. At the end of the day we demonstrated our completely original rollercoaster designs.</p>

                  <p class="post-excerpt">On Thursday we had a talk with Rachel, which was initially meant to be abot Maximising Internships, but ended up being aboout her path in the industry, and how most tech companies will tend to look for the person who they believe will work the best with their team-who can ask for help, and give it- as opposed to the most technically capable one. After that we had a talk with Paulo, a Redhat employee in Italy, who managed to include his passion (Formula 1 Racing) with his job at Redhat, by using telemetry data from Formula Xbox games. I liked this talk as it opened my eyes to how you can apply your passionto your job. At the end of the day we had a final workshop with Christian, where we worked on a basic game, fixing bugs and customizing it to our liking.  </p>
